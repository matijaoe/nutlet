[Cashu](https://cashu.space/) web wallet. 

what?
> Cashu is a free and open-source Chaumian ecash protocol built for Bitcoin. A digital bearer token that is stored on a user's device, very similar to physical cash. The Cashu protocol allows you to build applications such as wallets or voucher systems. Transactions are instant and nearly free.

why?
> I want to build something in the Bitcoin space. I'm inspired by what's [callebtc](https://github.com/callebtc) doing and incredibly excited about the potential of ecash on Bitcoin. I wan't to learn first-hand about how it all works.

goals?
> Modern minimal interface, inspired by Strike & Cash App. Obsessive focus on UX. Support for advanced features, seamlessly integrated without overwhelming users.

platform?
> For now, this will be a regular mobile-sized PWA build in Nuxt 3. May throw in Tauri in the mix. If it gains traction, I might port it to Expo / React Native.

Currently, I'm just experimenting with the design 👇🏻
